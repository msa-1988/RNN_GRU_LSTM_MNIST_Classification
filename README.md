# RNN_GRU_LSTM_MNIST_Classification
MNIST is a popular benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. In this project, we will explore the performance of RNN, GRU, and LSTM model  for classifying the MNIST digits
Welcome to my Colab notebook showcasing my skills in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for MNIST data classification. In this notebook, I have implemented and trained three different types of RNN models: RNN, GRU, and LSTM. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in working with sequential data and applying deep learning techniques for classification tasks.

Steps Taken:

Data Preprocessing:

I started by loading the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images.
To prepare the data for training, I performed necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization and reshaping the input images.
Model Implementation:

I designed and implemented three types of RNN models: RNN, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
Each model was built using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, and customized according to the specific architecture of the respective RNN variant.
Model Training:

Next, I trained each RNN model using the preprocessed MNIST dataset.
The training process involved feeding the input sequences to the RNN models and optimizing their parameters to minimize the loss function.
I utilized a suitable optimizer, such as Adam, and applied backpropagation through time to update the model weights.
Evaluation and Accuracy:

Once the training was completed, I evaluated the performance of each RNN model on a separate test dataset.
By making predictions on the test data, I calculated the accuracy of each model to assess their classification performance.
The accuracy metric provides insights into the model's ability to correctly classify the handwritten digits.
By implementing and training these RNN models on the MNIST dataset, I aimed to showcase my proficiency in working with sequential data and utilizing RNN architectures for classification tasks. The notebook demonstrates my ability to preprocess data, build neural network models, train them using appropriate optimization techniques, and evaluate their performance.
